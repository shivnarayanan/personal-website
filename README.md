# Personal Website

This is my personal website that was built with Flask and deployed using AWS Elastic Beanstalk. The website is a work in progress. 

This project explores the following skills:
  1. Web Design (HTML, CSS)
  2. Scripting (Python, Bash)
  3. Cloud Computing (AWS Elastic Beanstalk, AWS Route 53) 
  4. WSGI Framework (Flask)
  5. Continuous Deployment (AWS CodePipeline)

This is the [link](https://www.shivnarayanan.me) to the live website.
