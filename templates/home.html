        <h1>SHIV NARAYANAN</h1>
        <p>Hello. I am currently a second-year undergradute at the Singapore Management University studying 
            Information Systems with a major in Smart City Management and Technology. I have a keen interest 
            in Data Engineering and have been picking up the relevant skills during my free time. Take a look 
            at my GitHub to see my projects! I would greatly appreciate any opportunity that would help me 
            cultivate and further hone my skills in Data Engineering. </p>

        <p> Apart from that, I am a coffee lover and you can find me running at Punggol Waterway every evening! </p>
            
        <p> - I am currently setting up the backend infrastructure for this site and will soon add in more content - </p>
